## Policies 

### Colaboration policy
Collaboration and discussion are crucial for this class. You will most likely find that you will gain a better
understanding of the material by discussing the problems with peers. Our goal is to ensure that the collaboration is appropriate and
effective, and that you become an independent problem solver capable to do work on your own. 
All students are expected to be familiar with
and to comply with the department's [collaboration
policy](https://turing.bowdoin.edu/dept/collab.php) and the four
levels of collaboration it outlines. Specifically for this class,

  * **In-class work and labs:** *collaboration-level 0*; that is, no restrictions.

  * **Assignments:**  *collaboration-level 1*;
      that is, verbal collaboration without solution sharing. You are
      allowed and encouraged to discuss ideas with other class
      members, but the communication should be verbal. No one is
      allowed to take notes during the discussion (being able to
      recreate the solution later from memory is proof that you
      actually understood it). Communication needs to stay at a high
      level and cannot include sharing pseudo-code for the problem.

  * **Exams:** *collaboration-level 3* (no collaboration
      allowed, professor clarifications only).

### Assignment Internet policy

There are lots of resources online, such as lecture
notes, animations, visualizations, practice problems, video
recordings, which you are encouraged to explore to help you understand
the material. However, you must be careful not to search the internet
for specific problems with the intent to get hints for their
solutions. __Searching for the assignment problems on the internet,
and this includes ChatGPT, violates academic honesty for this class.__



### Assignment Partner Policy

You may work on the assignments with **one** partner (teams of at most
2 people). You can have the same partner for all assignments, or you
can change partners. You and your partner(s) will work together on the
assignment throughout the whole process, you will write it and review
it together, and will submit one assignment. The assignment must be a
true joint effort, equally owned, created and understood by both
partners. Specifically splitting the assignment and working on the
problems separately is not allowed and violates the honor code for the
class.


### Assignment late policy 

Assignments submitted past the posted deadline will be accepted but
will incur a penalty of .4% per hour (9.6% per day), which will be
automatically applied in Canvas.  Most topics build directly on prior
topics, so it is critical not to fall behind!

#### Flex days 
#To provide some flexibility  you are allotted __three flex days__ for
#the semester, each of which may be used to submit an assignment or a
#quiz up to 24 hours late (up to 72 hours late if all three flex days
#are applied all at once). For a team assignment, applying a flex day
#uses a flex day from each group memberâ€™s allotment. If you want to use
#a Flex day please message me on Slack clearly stating which flex days
#you want use and for which assignment/quiz (for e.g. "I would like to
#use 1st flex day for assignment 4").  

#Since Canvas does not implement Flex days at the moment, at the end of
#the semester I will go through your assignments and quizzes and I will
#waive three late penalties (corresponding to three flex days).

### Emergencies 

Exceptions to the late policy will be made in case of significant
circumstances (such as you are sick in bed, concussion, etc). If
such a situation arises please let me know as soon as possible.
Note that the circumstances have to be _significant_ (for e.g. taking
two classes with homework deadlines the same day, or traveling for
athletics events or hackathons, do not count as an emergency). 


### Regrades

You can submit a regrade request within 7 days of receiving your
grade. You should do this only if you believe there is a grading
error, not simply because you want a higher grade.  If the assignment
was handled via Gradescope, you can submit the Regrade request on
Gradescope. Otherwise, send me a message on Slack.
