## Resources 


__Textbook:__ The class is based on the following textbook: Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, McGraw Hill, New York. The book is not required. It is available online, and there are copies in Searles 224. 

If you want to dive deeper into proofs and the mathematics of computer science, here are two good (free) resources: 

- [Building blocks for theoretical computer science](http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/building-blocks/) by Margaret Fleck
- [Mathematics for Computer science](http://opendatastructures.org/LLM.pdf)by Lehman, Leighton and Meyer

There are lots of resources online, such as  videos, animations, visualizations, practice problems and solutions, which you are encouraged to explore to deepen your understanding of the material. However, you must be careful __not to search the internet for specific problems__ with the intent of finding  their solutions.  Copying solutions from the internet violates academic honesty.  


Below is a list of resources  (by no means exhaustive) which I used and which I highly recommend.
